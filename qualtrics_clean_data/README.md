# About
This directory is intentionally empty because of IRB rules.  
This is where the "cleaned" qualtrics data should be.  

# Directory structure 
Each year of qualtrics data has its own directory. Data files are separated based on how survey was designed (e.g. if sibs were sent a different link than TYP kids).
